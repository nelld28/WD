	<h2>Subjects of study</h2>
	<p>
		At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. Saying that, of the ideas you submittes we were most intregued by are as follows:
	</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
			<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exeeding 30&#8451; (86&#8457;), when the audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup>>3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
			<li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
		</ol> 

	<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
	<p>
		Dances with definitions are as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
		Polynesian chicken dance
	</p>
		<dl>
			
			<dd>
				A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
			</dd>
		</dl>
	
	<p>
